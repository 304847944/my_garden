  <!-- Sets the minimum and maximum tilt tolerance for each possible rotation.
         This array consists of 4 pairs of values which specify the minimum and maximum
         tilt angle at which the device will transition into each rotation.

         The tilt angle represents the direction in which the plane of the screen is facing;
         it is also known as the angle of elevation.

           -90 degree tilt means that the screen is facing straight down
                           (the device is being held overhead upside-down)
             0 degree tilt means that the screen is facing outwards
                           (the device is being held vertically)
            90 degree tilt means that the screen is facing straight up
                           (the device is resting on a flat table)

        The default tolerances are set conservatively such that the device is more
        likely to remain in its natural orientation than rotate into a counterclockwise,
        clockwise, or reversed posture (with an especially strong bias against the latter)
        to prevent accidental rotation while carrying the device in hand.

        These thresholds may need to be tuned when the device is intended to be
        mounted into a dock with a particularly shallow profile wherein rotation
        would ordinarily have been suppressed.

        It is helpful to consider the desired behavior both when the device is being
        held at a positive tilt (typical case) vs. a negative tilt (reading overhead in
        bed) since they are quite different.  In the overhead case, we typically want
        the device to more strongly prefer to retain its current configuration (in absence
        of a clear indication that a rotation is desired) since the user's head and neck may
        be held at an unusual angle.
